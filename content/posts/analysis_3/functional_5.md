There is an additional structure on $B(X,Y)$ if $X,Y$ are Hilbert spaces, which enables us to obtain a simpler characterization of invertibility. This is the <span style = "color:orange">*adjoint*</span> of an operator.

  * Definition and properties of adjoints.
  * Adjoints and invertibility.
  * Three important operators (normal, self-adjoint and unitary operators) that are related to the adjoint, and their properties.
  * Spectrum of operators.

## 1. Adjoint
In this section we define the adjoint and show its existence and uniqueness.
